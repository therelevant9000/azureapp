# azureapp
* Just a few things
1. I need to setup two cicd pipelines
* I need to get docker running the web app correctly
* I need to setup a second repo for IAC (lets use github projects to track the two repos)
2. This will start as a simple static webpage using vanilla html + css and
grow into a MERN app. The goal is to run a store with a payment backend on kubuernetes
* This is practice for that, but I won't actually implement the real store in this repo. 
3. I will add more goals and clarifications to this readme as i go, so TBA
