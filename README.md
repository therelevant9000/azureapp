* Just a few things
1. I need to setup two cicd pipelines
* Figure out this docker shit

2. This will start as a simple static webpage using vanilla html + css and
grow into a MERN app. The goal is to run a store with a payment backend.
3. I will add more goals and clarifications to this readme as i go, so TBA
